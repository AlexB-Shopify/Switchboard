# Production Mode Configuration Overrides
# These settings are applied when running in production mode

# Note: Most production schedules are already defined in switchboard.yaml
# This file can be used for production-specific overrides

# Example: You might want different heartbeat intervals in production
# heartbeatIntervalMs: 30000  # 30 seconds for more responsive syncing
