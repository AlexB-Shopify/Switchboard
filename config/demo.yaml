# Demo Mode Configuration Overrides
# These settings are applied when running in demo mode
# Schedules are compressed for faster demonstration

# Note: Most demo schedules are already defined in switchboard.yaml
# This file can be used for additional demo-specific overrides

# Example: You could disable certain data objects for demos
# dataObjects:
#   discounts:
#     enabled: true  # Enable discounts for demo
